vorticity confinment:
- vorticity vector field:
    omega = curl of velocity

    N = normalized (grad( curl field )) - vectors that point to center of rotation
    
    N poitns to center, omega points along axis of rotation so 
        f_confinment = N x omega (cross product) * dx * (scaling factor)



Done:
Use runge-kutta for advection
